// (Best/Worst/Avg Running Time: O(nlog(n)); Space: O(n))
//
// MergeSort is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer
// approach to order elements in an array.
//
// Mergesort runs in a *guaranteed* time, which is significantly faster than the
// average and worst-case running times of several other sorting algorithms.
//
// Here is the recursive mergesort algorithm, in plain English:
//
// * If the list has only one element, return the list and terminate. (base case)
// * Split the list into two halves that are as equal in length as possible. (divide)
// * Using recursion, sort both lists using mergesort. (conquer)
// * Merge the two sorted lists and return the result. (combine)
