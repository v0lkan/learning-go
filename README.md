## About This Repository

This is a repository that I experiment with the
[Go language](https://golang.org). — Feel free to tag along :)

## The Folder Structure

Each folder under the root of this repository is a mini Go project that assumes
to have a separate `GOPATH`.

So for example when running `./hello-strings` the `$GOPATH` environment variable
should be set to that folder.

The sub-folders of  these folders reflect a typical Go project folder structure:

* `src`: Source files.
* `bin`: Generated binary files.
* etc.

## Where Do The Examples Come From?

I curate them from various sources. I also write some of them myself.

I’ll be listing the resources that I utilize here, though if I miss to give credit
where it’s due, just let me know, and I’ll update this page accordingly.

* <https://golang.org/> and <https://tour.golang.org/>
* … more to come …

## What Happened to the Older Files

Well… I deleted them because I wanted a fresh start.

You can browse the this repo’s history if you’re curious.
