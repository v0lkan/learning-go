Some code you see here are either identical or slighly modified forms of `go tool tour` website.

I am also copying and pasting from other publicly available sources.

Some of the sources that I used are here, though I don’t have time and energy to book keep all my sources, as my goal is to learn s#!% first.

So if you feel like I’ve forgotten to give attribution to your work, please let me know via <me@volkan.io> and I will respond promptly.
