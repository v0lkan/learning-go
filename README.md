## About This Repository

This is a repository that I experiment with the [Go language](https://golang.org). — Feel free to tag along :)

## The Folder Structure

* Project root will also be the `$GOPATH` I’m working on.
* `src` will contain the go packages as usual.
* `src/volkan.io` will be the main project workspace.
* `src/volkan.io/examples` will contain runnable binaries.
    * So, for example, executing `go run src/volkan.io/examples/000_tree_info.go` will run a sample binary.

## Where Do The Examples Come From?

I curate them from various sources. I also write some of them myself.

I’ll be listing the resources that I utilize here, though if I miss to give credit where it’s due, just let me know, and I’ll update this page accordingly.

* <https://golang.org/> and <https://tour.golang.org/>
* … more to come …

## What Happened to the Older Files

Well… I deleted them because I wanted a fresh start.

You can browse the this repo’s history if you’re curious.
