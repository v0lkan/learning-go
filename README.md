## About This Repository

This is a repository that I experiment with the [Go language](https://golang.org). — Feel free to tag along :)

## The Folder Structure

* Project root will also be the `$GOPATH` I’m working on.
* `src` will contain the go packages as usual.
* `src/volkan.io` will be the main project workspace.
* `src/volkan.io/examples` will contain runnable binaries.
    * So, for example, executing `go run src/volkan.io/examples/000_tree_info.go` will run a sample binary.

## What Happened to the Older Files

Well… I deleted them because I wanted a fresh start.
