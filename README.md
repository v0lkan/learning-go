## About Learning Go

This is a repository that I collect the [Go](https://golang.org) 
source code that I play with from time to time.

## What Happened to the Older Files

Wellâ€¦ I deleted them because I wanted a fresh start.

You can browse the this repoâ€™s history if youâ€™re curious.

## The Folder Structure

The folder structure is a mess, to be honest :).

Typically, every root-level folder contains a self-sufficient project with 
a `main()` function that you can run on its own. Thereâ€™s not much comments 
(*sorry*) and not much documentation (*sorry again*) to explain whatâ€™s going on.
But the examples are small, and contained enough that you can reason about 
by simply reading the source code or tracing and debugging it.

Thereâ€™s also an `./archive` folder that I sweeped older code to be revised under
the rug.

Best way to navigate the code is to clone the repo and use your IDEâ€™s search
feature to find stuff that you are interested in.

## Licensing

Iâ€™m distributing this codebase under an [MIT License
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) unless otherwise notified.

## Where Do The Examples Come From?

The code you see here is all written by me; however, some of the files 
are either direct copies, or slight variations of publicly-available 
examples from various booksâ€™ source code repositories; blogs, tutorials, 
websites and articles; and other resources including but not limited to the 
following:

* [Go Official Website](https://golang.org)
* [Programming in Go: Creating Applications for the 21st Century](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321774639)
* [Concurrency in Go](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491941197)
* [Introducing Go: Build Reliable, Scalable Programs](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491941952/)
* [The Go Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134190440)
* [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/)
* [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
* â€¦ more to come â€¦

## Hey, You Forgot to Add My Book/Article/Website Here

I donâ€™t spend too much time in this repo, and I donâ€™t have time to keep the 
attribution list up-to-date. 

Itâ€™s also not an easy task becuase some of the  examples are so generic and 
canonical that you can find in multiple resources in more-or-less identical forms, 
and some of the examples are *my personal take* on existing samples and they 
have deviated so much from their original form that it is hard to discern whether 
it is derived work. 

If you are the author of some of the examples here that Iâ€™ve forgotten to give
proper attribution to, or if you have special licensing requirements, or if you
want your code to be updated or removed from this repo, [please send me an 
email](mailto:me@volkan.io) and Iâ€™ll take care of it as soon as I can.

Thanks,

And may the source be with you,

Volkan ðŸ¦„.
